# Idle Hands
Manages user inactivity across all browser windows.

This is a _**zero-dependency**_ rewrite of the [jQuery Idle Hands plugin](https://github.com/totallyquiche/jquery-idle-hands) written in _**pure JavaScript**_.

## Compatibility

As of 06/2020, Idle Hands has been tested on the latest versions of the following browsers:
* Firefox
* Google Chrome
* Safari
* Internet Explorer
* Edge

## Usage
```html
<script>
    idleHands.start();
</script>
```

### With Custom Settings
```html
<script>
    idleHands.start({
        applicationId: 'my_application',
        heartRate: 5,
        inactivityDialogDuration: 10,
        inactivityLogoutUrl: 'https://www.google.com',
        maxInactivitySeconds: 15
    });
</script>
```

## Settings
|Name|Default Value|Description|
|---|---|--|
|`activityEvents`|`'click keypress scroll wheel mousewheel mousemove'`|This is a string of DOM event types which count as user activity.|
|`applicationId`|`'idle-hands'`|This is a unique identifier used to namespace local storage and HTML classes/IDs. It should be changed to something unique to your application.|
|`dialogMessage`|`'Your session is about to expire due to inactivity.'`|This is the message that appears inside of the inactivity dialog above the timer.|
|`dialogTimeRemainingLabel`|`'Time remaining'`| This is the message that appears in the inactivity dialog before the number of seconds remaining.|
|`dialogTitle`|`'Session Expiration Warning'`|This is the message that appears at the very top of the inactivity dialog.|
|`documentTitle`|`null`|This is the message that appears at the top of the browser tab or window. When left `null`, this will default to `dialogTitle`.|
|`heartbeatCallback`|`null`|This is the function that will be called after every successful request to the heartbeat URL. The following parameters are passed in from the `$.get()` request: `data`, `textStatus`, `jqXHR`.|
|`heartbeatUrl`|`window.location.href`|This is the "keep-alive" URL. Idle Hands will make an AJAX request to this URL once every `heartRate` number of seconds. This can be used to prevent your application session from expiring before the inactivity timer finishes counting down.|
|`heartRate`|`300`|This is how often Idle Hands will make an AJAX request to `heartbeatUrl`.|
|`inactivityLogoutUrl`|`'https://www.google.com'`|This is the URL that users will be redirected to if the inactivity dialog timer reaches 0 seconds.|
|`inactivityDialogDuration`|`45`|This is how before a user is logged out that the inactivity dialog will display for.|
|`localStoragePrefix`|`null`|Keys in key/value pairs saved in the browser are prefixed with this value to help prevent conflicts with other applications storing data in the browser. When left `null`, this defaults to `applicationId`.|
|`logoutNowButtonText`|`'Logout Now'`|This is the text that will display on the logout button in the inactivity dialog.|
|`manualLogoutUrl`|`null`|This is the URL that users will be redirected to if they click the logout button on the inactivity dialog. When left `null`, this will default to `inactivityLogoutUrl`.|
|`maxInactivitySeconds`|`60`|This is the number of seconds a user can remain inactive before they are automatically redirected to `inactivityLogoutUrl`.|
|`stayLoggedInButtonText`|`'Stay Logged In'`|This is the text that will display on the reset button in the inactivity dialog.|
